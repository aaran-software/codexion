We’re building Codexion, a full-stack enterprise platform for ERP, CRM, e-commerce, LMS, AI, and more, using Python + React + PostgreSQL.
It’s powered by Prefiq (a pure, open-source framework) and organized into:

Prefiq → reusable framework code

Cortex → main backend brain (global settings, dashboard, core APIs)

Apps → modular, self-contained apps (each with backend, shared core, frontend)

Sites → multi-tenant deployments

Resources → shared frontend/backend assets

The design ensures scalability, modularity, multi-tenant readiness, and developer separation of concerns for enterprise-grade automation.
