# Codexion Cortex — Final Blueprint (Expanded & Filled-in)

> Fully detailed, implementation-ready version of the Cortex blueprint — with concrete responsibilities, file/path hints, recommended patterns, tech suggestions, and actionable notes so any developer can pick this up after a reset.

---

## Summary (one-sentence)

**Cortex** is the Python framework core for **Codexion** that boots the system, provides platform services (DB, cache, auth, eventing), exposes stable extension points (plugins, hooks, themes), and supplies an AI & analytics layer for adaptive, data-driven ERP behaviors.

---

# 1. Bootstrapping & Initialization

**Goal:** deterministic, reproducible app startup with module discovery and lifecycle control.

**Responsibilities**

* `main.py` / `entry_point.py` — application entry (env detection → bootstrap).
* `erp/cortex/bootstrap.py` — orchestrates Boot sequence (CFG → IOC → SPV → MOD → ROUTES).
* `erp/cortex/lifecycle.py` — registers hooks: `on_preboot`, `on_boot`, `on_postboot`, `on_shutdown`.
* Docs auto-discovery: look for `apps/` packages with `app_manifest.py` or `entrypoint` metadata.
* Config override order: `.env` → `config/base.yaml` → `config/{env}.yaml` → tenant/site override.

**Implementation notes**

* Use a deterministic boot order; log each step with a timestamp and trace id.
* Provide `--dry-run` and `--migrate-only` CLI flags in `prefiq/` for safe ops.

---

# 2. Core Service Layer

**Goal:** platform primitives used by all modules.

**Services & Files**

* `erp/cortex/config.py` — hierarchical loader (`pydantic` settings recommended).
* `erp/cortex/logger.py` — structured JSON logs, correlation IDs.
* `erp/cortex/eventbus.py` — adapter interface supporting sync/async backends (Kafka/Rabbit).
* `erp/cortex/middleware.py` — pipeline registration and execution.
* `erp/cortex/queue.py` — task queue adapter (Celery/Dramatiq/RQ).
* `erp/cortex/cache.py` — unified cache API (Redis + in-memory fallback).
* `erp/cortex/providers/*.py` — DBProvider, AuthProvider, SearchProvider, StorageProvider.

**Tech choices (examples)**

* Config: `pydantic` / `Dynaconf`.
* Logging: `structlog` or Python `logging` with JSON handler.
* DB ORM: `SQLAlchemy` (sync/async) or `Tortoise` (async).
* MQ: `Kafka` or `RabbitMQ`.
* Cache: `redis-py`.
* Background: `Celery` or `Dramatiq`.

**Patterns**

* Use adapters (ports & adapters) so tests can inject mocks.
* Provide factory + singleton bindings in IoC container.

# 3. Data & Business Logic

**Goal:** robust domain model layer and stable data contracts.

**Structure**

```
erp/modules/<module>/
  models.py          # ORM models + mixins (timestamps, soft delete)
  repository.py      # DB access via repository pattern
  services.py        # business actions / domain services
  schemas.py         # pydantic DTOs for I/O
  workflows/         # saga/orchestrators, step functions
  migrations/        # alembic or equivalent
```

**Key features**

* DTOs (`pydantic`) for API contract + validation.
* Repositories isolate ORM — allows multi-DB strategies.
* Transformers map ORM → API/read models (CQRS read models optional).
* Multi-tenant strategies: `schema-per-tenant` OR `shared-schema + tenant_id` with row-level scoping.

**Versioning**

* Keep API and DB migration versions tied to module versions.
* Provide `erp/cortex/versioning.py` to manage compatibility checks at module load.

---

# 4. Security & Compliance

**Goal:** enterprise-grade security across stack.

**Controls**

* `erp/cortex/security/iam.py` — OAuth2/OpenID Connect client + JWT introspection.
* RBAC and PBAC enforced at controller + service level.
* Input sanitization & validation at API boundary; parameterized queries in repo.
* Request signing for third-party webhook/auth integrations.
* Audit trail: `erp/cortex/audit.py` → immutable append-only events (optionally replicate to secure store).
* Secrets: integrate with Vault / cloud KMS at bootstrap; no plaintext secrets in repo.
* DLP & PII handling: tag sensitive fields and apply field-level encryption.

**Testing & CI**

* SAST/DAST runs in CI.
* Security regression tests and permission matrix checks.

---

# 5. Extensibility & Customization

**Goal:** let teams and partners extend Codexion safely without core changes.

**Systems**

* **Plugin Loader** — `erp/cortex/plugin_manager.py`

  * Plugin manifest: `plugin.yml` (name, hooks, migrations, assets, routes).
  * Supports install/uninstall lifecycle and version compatibility checks.
* **Hook & Observer System** — `erp/cortex/hooks.py`

  * Hook points: `before_create`, `after_update`, `on_login`, `before_migrate`, etc.
* **Theme Engine** — `erp/cortex/themes/loader.py`

  * Asset override strategy: core assets ← tenant theme ← plugin assets.
* **Custom Fields** — `erp/modules/<module>/custom_fields.py` using JSONB and mapping service.

**Safety**

* Plugins run in sandboxed processes or limited permission contexts when required.
* Plugin signing and marketplace vetting recommended.

---

# 6. Observability & Health

**Goal:** measure, diagnose, and maintain reliability.

**Exports**

* `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints.
* `/metrics` for Prometheus (SLIs like latency, error rate, throughput).
* OpenTelemetry tracing integrated in controllers, services, DB, MQ.
* Centralized logs (ELK/EFK) with structured fields: `trace_id`, `span_id`, `module`, `tenant`, `user_id`.

**SLOs & Runbooks**

* Store SLOs in `config/slo.yaml`.
* Runbooks for on-call in `docs/runbooks/` and link from alerts.

---

# 7. AI & Data Analytics Layer

**Goal:** extract value from historical & live ERP data for prediction, recommendations, and automation.

**Components**

* `erp/ai/ingest.py` — connectors to ETL data into Feature Store / Data Lake.
* **Feature Store** — store engineered features (can be in DB or specialized store).
* `erp/ai/training/` — pipelines (MLflow / Kubeflow) and model registry.
* `erp/ai/serving/` — low-latency inferencing API (gRPC/REST) with model versioning.
* `erp/ai/recommendation.py` — recommender microservice or module.
* `erp/ai/nlp/` — NLP interface for natural-language queries (RBAC applied).
* **Experience Memory Layer** — store actions, outcomes, and feedback for continual learning.

**MLOps**

* Model governance: lineage, explainability, drift detection.
* CI for models: tests, fairness checks, performance tracking.
* Retraining schedules and rollback plans.

**Privacy**

* Pseudonymize/anonymize training data as needed.
* Maintain consent & data retention policies.

---

# 8. Internationalization & Future-Proofing

**Goal:** serve global customers and evolve with new tech.

**i18n**

* `erp/cortex/i18n/` — translation catalogs, locale detection, formatting helpers.
* UI translatable strings and server-side message catalogs.

**Future Modules**

* Provision extension points for **IoT**, **blockchain** audit trails, **edge sync** for offline devices.

**Scalability**

* Stateless API pods, stateful DB with read replicas, MQ for decoupling, autoscaling on CPU/QPS/MQ backlog.

---

# 9. DevOps, CI/CD & Reliability

**Goal:** safe, repeatable deployments and recovery.

**Components**

* GitOps (ArgoCD) + CI (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI): build, test, SAST, DAST, canary deploy.
* Blue/Green or Canary deployments for critical services.
* Backup & DR: scheduled snapshots, cross-region replication, documented RTO/RPO.
* Chaos experiments for resilience testing.

**Developer DX**

* Local dev sandbox: `devstack` scripts to run services with test fixtures.
* Scaffolding CLI in `prefiq/` to generate modules, controllers, tests.

---

# 10. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal:** ensure correctness and contract stability.

**Tests**

* Unit tests (`pytest`), integration tests, contract tests (Pact), E2E (Playwright/Cypress), load tests (k6).
* Contract tests for APIs + Feature flagged behavior.
* Security tests: SAST, DAST in pipeline.

**Coverage**

* Gate merges on test + coverage thresholds and passing security checks.

---

# 11. Governance, Policies & Documentation

**Goal:** consistent architecture decisions and operational policies.

**Artifacts**

* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `/docs/adr/`.
* Data contracts & schemas registered in a schema registry (Avro/Protobuf).
* Policy docs: retention, encryption, access control.
* Module owner metadata for accountability.

---

# 13. Non-Functional Requirements (quick, actionable)

* **Availability:** 99.95% for core API, multi-AZ DB.
* **RTO/RPO:** define per critical module (example: Payments RTO = 15min, RPO = 1hr).
* **Latency:** 95th percentile API response < 300ms (tunable per endpoint).
* **Throughput:** autoscale policies based on QPS & MQ backlog.
* **Security:** SOC2/ISO-27001 baseline for production.
