# Codexion 

**One-line:** Cortex is the Python framework core for Codexion — bootstrapping, platform services, secure extensibility, observability, and an AI/ML stack — engineered for enterprise scale, compliance, and long-term evolution.

---

## Guiding Principles

* **Modularity**: modules/apps are first-class, replaceable units.
* **Separation of Concerns**: thin controllers, domain services, repositories.
* **Testability**: DI + adapters everywhere for easy mocking.
* **Security-First**: default-secure design (least privilege, encryption, audit).
* **Operability**: telemetry, SLOs, runbooks, and GitOps.
* **Future-Ready**: ML feature store, model governance, plugin marketplace.

## Finalized Sections (all merged + expanded)

### 1. Bootstrapping & Initialization

* `main.py` → `erp/cortex/bootstrap.py` (deterministic boot sequence: CFG → IOC → SPV → MOD → ROUTES → HEALTH).
* Support `--dry-run`, `--migrate-only`, `--safe-upgrade`.
* Docs discovery: `app_manifest.py` or Python entry\_point + semantic version check.
* Lifecycle hooks: `on_preboot`, `on_boot`, `on_ready`, `on_shutdown`, `on_upgrade`.
* Boot logging with `trace_id`, `boot_step`, `duration`.

### 2. Core Service Layer

* `erp/cortex/config.py` (pydantic-based), `logger.py` (structured), `ioc.py` (container).
* Providers: `DBProvider`, `CacheProvider`, `AuthProvider`, `SearchProvider`, `StorageProvider`, `FeatureFlagProvider`, `MLProvider`.
* Adapters for MQ (Kafka/Rabbit), Background (Celery/Dramatiq), Cache (Redis), Storage (S3).
* Feature flags + A/B experiments support.

### 3. Data & Business Logic

* Module layout per `erp/modules/<module>/` (models, repository, services, schemas, workflows, migrations).
* Repository pattern, DTOs (Pydantic), optional CQRS + read-models, idempotency tokens for commands.
* Schema evolution: Avro/Protobuf for contracts, schema registry for event & API contracts.
* Migrations & data migrations with migration-plan and backward-compatible change rules.

### 4. Security & Compliance (hardened)

* IAM: OAuth2/OpenID Connect, SSO, JWT lifecycle (refresh, revocation).
* RBAC + PBAC + attribute-based policies; permission matrix tests in CI.
* Secrets: Vault/KMS integration, automated rotation, no plaintext.
* SAST/DAST + dependency scanning (SBOM), DLP, PII tagging, field-level encryption, key management (BYOK support).
* Web protections: WAF, rate-limiting, CSRF, CORS, input sanitization.
* Logging: PII redaction rules and privacy-by-design audit logging.
* Compliance: GDPR, PCI, SOC2 operational hooks, retention & consent workflows.

### 5. Extensibility & Customization

* Plugin manager with sandboxing & signing; `plugin.yml` manifest; version compatibility on install.
* Theme engine (assets, templates) with override precedence: core < plugin < tenant.
* Hook system with typed hooks and RBAC for plugin actions.
* Plugin marketplace & signing flow (vetting checklist).
* Custom fields (JSONB + metadata service) and safe indexing strategy.

### 6. Observability, Health & Ops

* `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, tracing (OpenTelemetry).
* Logs → ELK/EFK; metrics → Prometheus; dashboards → Grafana.
* Standard telemetry fields: `trace_id`, `span_id`, `service`, `module`, `tenant`, `user_id`, `env`, `request_id`.
* SLOs stored in `config/slo.yaml`; automated alert runbooks with on-call escalations and post-incident ADR creation.
* Incident response templates, playbooks in `docs/runbooks/`.

### 7. AI & Data Analytics (enterprise-grade)

* ETL connectors + Data Lake ingestion (`erp/ai/ingest.py`), feature store (feature registry).
* Training pipelines + model registry (MLflow/Kubeflow), model CI (tests, fairness, explainability).
* Serving layer: low-latency inference, batch scoring, model versioning, canary model rollouts.
* Experience Memory: store actions+outcomes+feedback; feed into continual learning loop.
* Privacy: anonymization/pseudonymization and consent-aware training.

### 8. Internationalization, Offline & Future Modules

* i18n, L10n, locale-aware formatting, currency handling.
* Offline sync for mobile/edge with conflict resolution strategy & sync engine.
* Extension readiness for IoT telemetry, blockchain audit trails, edge caching.

### 9. DevOps, CI/CD, Reliability & Governance

* GitOps + ArgoCD, CI pipelines (lint, unit, integration, contract, SAST/DAST, deploy).
* Canary/Blue-Green deployment, feature flag gated rollouts.
* Backup & DR: automated snapshots, cross-region replication, tested restore runbooks, RTO/RPO per tier.
* Chaos engineering for critical paths.
* ADRs, data & model governance, policy enforcement; governance board & module owners.

### 10. Testing & Quality Assurance

* Unit (pytest), integration, contract (Pact), E2E (Playwright/Cypress), performance (k6), SAST/DAST.
* API mock servers, test fixtures, staging with production-like data (anonymized).
* Merge gates: tests + coverage + security.

---

## Deployment Topology (recommended)

* K8s clusters (multi-AZ) with node pools for api, workers, ml-serving (GPU), and plugin-sandbox.
* Managed Postgres (primary + read replicas), Redis cluster, Kafka, S3-compatible storage.
* CI/CD: build → unit → integration → contract → staging → canary → prod (GitOps apply).
