# ERP Provider Layer – Repository Structure, Blueprint & TODOs

## 1) Repositories Overview

* **/providers-core** – Abstract base provider definitions, contracts, and shared utilities.
* **/providers-database** – Service providers for database engines (Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, etc.).
* **/providers-integrations** – External app/site integrations (CRM, ERP extensions, SaaS APIs).
* **/providers-ui** – UI gateway components and layout templates.
* **/providers-logic** – Business logic orchestration layer.
* **/providers-ai** – AI services (recommendation, NLP, forecasting, decision support).
* **/providers-workflows** – Workflow engine and orchestration layer.
* **/providers-security** – Authentication, authorization, and auditing.
* **/providers-observability** – Logging, metrics, and monitoring connectors.

## 2) Base Contracts

* Define abstract classes/interfaces for providers:

  * connect()
  * disconnect()
  * execute(action, payload)
  * get\_status()
* Each provider inherits from the base class and implements specific methods.

## 3) API Layer

* REST and GraphQL endpoints.
* Routes structured as `/providers/{service}/{action}`.
* Authentication/authorization middleware.

## 4) Multi-Tenancy

* Tenant-aware provider instances.
* Database sharding/partitioning strategies.
* Secure data isolation.

## 5) Security

* Centralized IAM.
* Audit logs.
* Encryption at rest and in transit.
* Zero-trust networking.

## 6) Observability

* Standardized logging schema.
* Distributed tracing.
* Metrics exposure for Prometheus/Grafana.

## 7) Workflow Layer

* Orchestration between providers.
* BPMN-like workflow engine.
* Retry, compensation, and rollback mechanisms.

## 8) UI Gateway

* Shared UI components.
* Provider-driven widgets.
* Pluggable dashboards.

## 9) Business Logic Layer

* Encapsulation of core ERP rules.
* Policy enforcement.
* Workflow orchestration logic.

## 10) AI Layer

* Predictive analytics.
* Recommendation systems.
* Document processing and NLP.
* Conversational AI integration.

## 11) Roadmap & TODOs

* Phase 1: Core provider contracts and registry.
* Phase 2: Database + external app integrations.
* Phase 3: UI and business logic orchestration.
* Phase 4: AI services and advanced analytics.
* Phase 5: Full observability and workflow automation.

## 12) Testing Strategy

* **Contract tests:** Ensure all providers comply with the base interface.
* **Integration tests:** Validate provider interaction with real services.
* **End-to-end tests:** Cover ERP workflows end-to-end.
* **Performance tests:** Benchmark provider scaling under load.

### Governance & Standards

* Unified coding standards across repos.
* Strict versioning and backward compatibility.
* Documentation-first approach.

### Risks & Mitigations

* **Vendor lock-in:** Mitigated with pluggable provider architecture.
* **Scalability issues:** Horizontal scaling of providers and workflow engine.
* **Security breaches:** Continuous audits and compliance checks.

### Next Steps

* Finalize base provider contracts.
* Define CI/CD pipelines for all repositories.
* Establish cross-functional governance board.
