Got it ✅

Here’s a **map of your repository** with the files you uploaded, along with short explanations so you can see how everything fits together:

---

### **Core System**

* **`bootstrap.py`**
  Entry point: boots the application, registers providers, and shows DB engine info.

* **`core/application.py`**
  Defines the `Application` singleton, service container, provider lifecycle (`register`, `boot`).

* **`core/provider.py`**
  Base `Provider` class + metaclass that auto-registers service providers.

* **`core/service_providers.py`**
  Discovers and lists providers (config, database, migration, app providers).

* **`core/discovery.py`**
  Logic to scan apps and roots for providers, apply include/exclude/order rules.

* **`core/logger.py`**
  Central logger with colored output, banner, badges, and utility helpers.

---

### **Database**

* **`database/connection.py`**
  Creates and manages global/named DB engine instances (sqlite, mariadb, postgres).

* **`database/connection_manager.py`**
  Wraps engine usage with sync/async transaction helpers, health check, closing.

---

### **CLI**

* **`main.py`**
  CLI root, mounts sub-apps (`doctor`, `app`, `provider`, `run`, `devmeta`).

* **`cli/apps.py`**
  Manage apps (new, drop, reinstall, list).

* **`cli/providers.py`**
  Inspect discovered providers via CLI.

* **`cli/doctor.py`**
  Health/migration diagnostics for boot, database, providers.

---

### **App Scaffolding**

* **`apps/app_builder.py`**
  Create, drop, reinstall app folders and update config.

* **`apps/app_stubs.py`**
  Generates stub files (README, provider, migration, init, pyproject).

* **`apps/app_cfg.py`**
  Manages `config/apps.cfg` (list apps, versions, add/remove).

---

### **Settings**

* **`settings/get_settings.py`**
  Central configuration loader (pydantic settings from `.env`), normalization, DSN builder.

---

✅ So your repo is structured like this:

* **Core framework** (application, providers, logger)
* **Database layer** (engines + connection manager)
* **CLI tools** (doctor, apps, providers, migrations)
* **App system** (scaffolding + configuration)
* **Settings** (pydantic + env loader)

Would you like me to also **map out the runtime flow** (how boot → providers → services → DB → CLI works step by step), so you can see where to insert your new Project Manager API?
