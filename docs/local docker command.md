⚠️ These actions are **irreversible**, so make sure you're not deleting anything important.

To **remove all unused Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks**, you can use Docker’s built-in **prune**
commands.

## 🧹 Full Cleanup: Remove Everything Not in Use

### 🧼 1. **Remove stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build cache**

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

* `-a`: also removes **unused images**, not just dangling ones.
* You'll be prompted to confirm.

**If you want to auto-confirm:**

```bash
docker system prune -a -f
```
