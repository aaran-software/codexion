Perfect — I’ve reviewed all the uploaded files. Here’s a clean **To-Do list** with only what’s left to do (no fluff, just what matters for Postgres + cross-DB builder).

---

# 🎯 Refined To-Do (Next Steps)

### **P0 — Must do for Postgres enablement**

1. **Extend Settings**

   * In `get_settings.py`, add `"postgres"` to `DB_ENGINE` Literal and default `DB_PORT=5432` when `DB_ENGINE=="postgres"`.

2. **Register Postgres Dialect**

   * In dialect registry (not in this snapshot, likely in `prefiq.database.engines`), un-comment/enable Postgres engine.

3. **Schema Builder Cross-DB**

   * Make `TableBlueprint` dialect-aware:

     * `id()` → use PG: `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`.
     * `timestamps()` → drop MySQL `ON UPDATE` for PG/SQLite.
     * `unique()` → PG: `CONSTRAINT name UNIQUE (...)` instead of MySQL inline key.
     * `index()` → strip inline for PG, create separately with `createIndex()`.
     * `enum()` → PG: use `CHECK (...)`.
     * Booleans → PG: `TRUE/FALSE`.

4. **Builder Index Handling**

   * Teach `builder.create()` to detect dialect and post-create indexes on PG/SQLite.

5. **Enable Providers**

   * In `service_providers.py`, uncomment `DatabaseProvider` and `MigrationProvider` so they bind (`db`, `migrator`).

### **P1 — PG safety & polish**

6. **Drop All with CASCADE**

   * In `drop_all()`, add `CASCADE` when PG.

7. **Migration Table Syntax**

   * Fix `_ensure_migrations_table()` so unique/index creation works after P0 builder changes.

8. **Settings QoL**

   * Auto default PG port, alias `"postgresql" → "postgres"` (already in validator 👍).

### **P2 — Quality / future hygiene**

9. **Doctor UX**

   * `doctor database --strict` should fail gracefully if DB not bound, and print DSN for PG too.

10. **Async Hygiene**

    * Guard `_await()` against “loop already running” when used under ASGI.

11. **Logging Filters**

    * Verify migration-table SQL suppression still applies after builder refactor.

12. **Test Matrix**

    * Smoke tests for all 4 engines: create/drop, enum/json/uuid, boolean/timestamp defaults, index handling.

✅ With this, Postgres will be first-class, and the schema builder is truly cross-dialect.
👉 Suggestion: start with **P0 (1–5)**, then circle back for **P1 safety (6–8)**.

Do you want me to draft the **exact code changes for (1–5)** so you can apply them directly?
