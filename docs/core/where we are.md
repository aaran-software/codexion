Got it üëç ‚Äî we won‚Äôt bring in heavy libs like **Pydantic** now.
Instead, we‚Äôll **keep validation optional/lightweight**, and move forward to the **next big piece of the ERP provider system**.

---

## ‚úÖ Where We Are

* **Application container** (`Application`) ‚Äî lifecycle + singleton.
* **BaseProvider** ‚Äî abstract contract.
* **SettingsProvider** ‚Äî unified global settings (env + yaml + json + db).
* **ProfilesProvider** ‚Äî environment-aware profiles loader.
* **Decorator (`@register_provider`)** ‚Äî auto-registration.

We now have a **working service provider system** with settings + profiles globally accessible.

## üîú Next Big Step Candidates

Here are logical next layers to build on top of `/core`:

### 1. **DatabaseProvider (foundation for ERP persistence)**

* Connect to DB using config from `settings`.
* Expose `db_session` or `db_client` globally (`app.resolve("db")`).
* Abstract over different engines (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite).

### 2. **UIProvider (gateway for front-end)**

* Serve templates or APIs to the UI.
* Register static paths & assets.
* Later plug into web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, etc.).

### 3. **WorkflowProvider**

* Orchestrate multi-step ERP flows.
* Provide retry, compensation, rollback.
* Base for business process automation.

### 4. **ObservabilityProvider**

* Central logging, metrics, and tracing.
* Hooks into all providers (`before_execute`, `after_execute`, `on_error`).

‚ö° My recommendation:
Move next to **DatabaseProvider** ‚Üí because ERP foundation depends heavily on persistence, and once DB is globally available, we can plug workflows, AI, UI, etc.

üëâ Do you want me to draft the **DatabaseProvider design doc + skeleton** (with TODOs for actual DB engine), so it‚Äôs aligned with your current `/core` system?
