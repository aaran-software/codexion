## 2. Core Components

### a) **Contracts**

* Abstract base classes for all providers (`BaseProvider`, `DatabaseProvider`, `IntegrationProvider`, etc.).
* Lifecycle methods enforced across all providers:

    * `connect()`
    * `disconnect()`
    * `execute(action: str, payload: dict)`
    * `get_status()`
* Optional lifecycle hooks: `initialize()`, `shutdown()`.
* Standardized error handling contract with custom exception hierarchy.
* Logging and tracing hooks defined at the contract level.
* Metadata contract (name, version, description, capabilities).
* Type safety enforced via **Python typing** and generics.

---

### b) **Registry**

* Centralized **Provider Registry** to register and retrieve provider implementations.
* Factory pattern:

    * `create_provider(name: str, config: dict)` ‚Üí returns a validated instance.
* Compliance validation with **BaseProvider** before activation.
* Supports lazy loading for performance.
* Plugin system for external extensions (dynamic discovery).
* Service locator for dependency injection between providers.

---

### c) **Helpers**

* Input validation utilities (schema validation, type enforcement).
* Data formatting and serialization.
* Common decorators (retry, timeout, caching).
* Shared constants and error codes.

---

### d) **Utils**

* Config loader (env variables, YAML/JSON, secrets vault integration).
* Standardized logging wrapper (structured logs, correlation IDs, trace IDs).
* Error taxonomy (`CoreError`, `ConfigError`, `ConnectionError`, etc.).
* Retry/backoff helpers with exponential strategies.

---

### e) **Docs**

* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
* Provider development guide (how to implement a new provider).
* Governance checklist (coding standards, testing compliance).
* Contribution and onboarding documentation.
* Architecture diagram showing how `/core` interacts with higher layers.

## 3. TODOs for `/core`

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation

* [ ] Define **BaseProvider** abstract class with lifecycle methods.
* [ ] Define specialized provider contracts: `DatabaseProvider`, `IntegrationProvider`, `UIProvider`, `AIProvider`.
* [ ] Implement optional lifecycle hooks: `initialize()`, `shutdown()`.
* [ ] Create metadata contract (`ProviderMetadata`).
* [ ] Set up project scaffolding (`pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, linting, typing, CI baseline).
* [ ] Implement error handling framework with extensible taxonomy.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Registry

* [ ] Implement provider registry with pluggable factory.
* [ ] Add compliance validation for provider contracts.
* [ ] Add service locator for dependency injection.
* [ ] Support lazy loading and plugin discovery.
* [ ] Write unit tests for registry lifecycle.

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Helpers & Utilities

* [ ] Implement config loader with schema validation (Pydantic).
* [ ] Add logger utility with structured logs (trace IDs, correlation IDs).
* [ ] Build retry/backoff decorators with exponential delay.
* [ ] Implement observability hooks (`before_execute`, `after_execute`, `on_error`).
* [ ] Add validation and serialization helpers.

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Testing & Documentation

* [ ] Provide `ProviderTestCase` for contract and integration testing.
* [ ] Add mock/fake providers for development/testing.
* [ ] Write contract tests to validate provider compliance.
* [ ] Document base contracts with examples.
* [ ] Provide architecture diagram and ADR templates.
* [ ] Define governance checklist for provider submissions.

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Security & Compliance

* [ ] Add config sanitization (strip secrets before logging).
* [ ] Implement encryption hooks for configs/secrets.
* [ ] Integrate audit logging (who called which provider, when).
* [ ] Ensure providers declare API version compatibility for backward safety.

‚úÖ With this structure, `/core` is **extensible**, **secure**, **observable**, and **developer-friendly**‚Äîready to serve
as the foundation for all enterprise ERP providers.
