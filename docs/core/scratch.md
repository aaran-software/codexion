Here are a few meaningful slogan-style notes you could add under **# 🏗️ `/core` –** to capture its purpose and philosophy:

---

# 🏗️ `/core` – The Base Provider

*“The foundation where every provider begins and every system connects.”*

📌 **Notes / Slogan Ideas:**

* **One Core, Many Providers** – unify contracts, scale without limits.
* **Consistency at the Center** – enforce lifecycle, governance, and reliability.
* **Build Once, Extend Everywhere** – shared utilities and contracts that power all providers.
* **Enterprise-Grade by Design** – security, observability, and compliance are first-class citizens.
* **The Spine of ERP Extensibility** – everything plugs in, nothing breaks.

Would you like me to **embed one short slogan directly in the doc header** (like a tagline under the title), or keep a section for multiple notes/slogans for inspiration?
