## 4. Roadmap

### MVP → Production Checklist (High Level)
1. Implement the minimal bootstrap (`cortex/bootstrap.py`) + IoC + config loader + logger.
2. Build an example module (Inventory) with models, repository, services, controllers, routes, and tests.
3. Integrate DB provider and migrations; add a cache provider (Redis).
4. Expose a sample API gateway and a minimal UI for demos.
5. Add an eventbus (in-memory for dev, Kafka/RabbitMQ in prod).
6. Create plugin loader framework and a sample plugin.
7. Integrate observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards).
8. Add authentication (OAuth2/JWT) and RBAC enforcement.
9. Configure CI/CD with SAST/DAST scanning and DR backup routines.
10. Onboard AI pipelines and feature store once stable data exists.

### Roadmap Notes & Prioritization

- **Phase 1 (Core Foundation):** Bootstrap, IoC, config, logging, DB, cache, simple module, CI basics.
- **Phase 2 (Platform Features):** Event bus, plugin system, auth, observability, staging environment.
- **Phase 3 (Scale & Safety):** Production-ready deployment (GitOps), DR, backups, security hardening.
- **Phase 4 (AI & Extensibility):** Feature store, training pipelines, model serving, plugin marketplace, advanced governance.

---

## 5. Workflow

### Startup & Lifecycle Flow

1. **Boot**: Load env/config → initialize IoC → register providers → discover modules → run migrations (optional) → register routes → mark ready.
2. **Lifecycle Hooks**: `on_preboot` → `on_boot` → `on_ready` → runtime → `on_shutdown`.

### Request Handling Flow

- Incoming request → middleware (auth, logging, validation) → controller → domain service → repository/events → response serialization. Include trace IDs and structured metadata for observability.

### Asynchronous & Background Flow

- Domain events published to Event Bus → consumed by worker pool (Celery/Dramatiq) → orchestrators/sagas handle multi-step processes → idempotency ensured via tokens or dedupe strategies.

### Data & ML Flow

- Operational data → ETL → feature store → training pipelines → model registry → inference service → feedback/experience memory → retraining loop.

### CI/CD Flow

- Commit → CI (lint, tests, security scans) → build artifact → GitOps deploy to staging → smoke tests → canary/blue-green deploy to production → monitor & rollback if SLOs violated.

# Codexion Cortex — Final Blueprint (Expanded & Filled-in)

> Fully detailed, implementation-ready version of the Cortex blueprint — with concrete responsibilities, file/path hints, recommended patterns, tech suggestions, and actionable notes so any developer can pick this up after a reset.

---

## Summary (one-sentence)

**Cortex** is the Python framework core for **Codexion** that boots the system, provides platform services (DB, cache, auth, eventing), exposes stable extension points (plugins, hooks, themes), and supplies an AI & analytics layer for adaptive, data-driven ERP behaviors.

---

# 1. Bootstrapping & Initialization

**Goal:** deterministic, reproducible app startup with module discovery and lifecycle control.

**Responsibilities**

* `main.py` / `entry_point.py` — application entry (env detection → bootstrap).
* `erp/cortex/bootstrap.py` — orchestrates Boot sequence (CFG → IOC → SPV → MOD → ROUTES).
* `erp/cortex/lifecycle.py` — registers hooks: `on_preboot`, `on_boot`, `on_postboot`, `on_shutdown`.
* App auto-discovery: look for `apps/` packages with `app_manifest.py` or `entrypoint` metadata.
* Config override order: `.env` → `config/base.yaml` → `config/{env}.yaml` → tenant/site override.

**Implementation notes**

* Use a deterministic boot order; log each step with a timestamp and trace id.
* Provide `--dry-run` and `--migrate-only` CLI flags in `prefiq/` for safe ops.

---

# 2. Core Service Layer

**Goal:** platform primitives used by all modules.

**Services & Files**

* `erp/cortex/config.py` — hierarchical loader (`pydantic` settings recommended).
* `erp/cortex/logger.py` — structured JSON logs, correlation IDs.
* `erp/cortex/eventbus.py` — adapter interface supporting sync/async backends (Kafka/Rabbit).
* `erp/cortex/middleware.py` — pipeline registration and execution.
* `erp/cortex/queue.py` — task queue adapter (Celery/Dramatiq/RQ).
* `erp/cortex/cache.py` — unified cache API (Redis + in-memory fallback).
* `erp/cortex/providers/*.py` — DBProvider, AuthProvider, SearchProvider, StorageProvider.

**Tech choices (examples)**

* Config: `pydantic` / `Dynaconf`.
* Logging: `structlog` or Python `logging` with JSON handler.
* DB ORM: `SQLAlchemy` (sync/async) or `Tortoise` (async).
* MQ: `Kafka` or `RabbitMQ`.
* Cache: `redis-py`.
* Background: `Celery` or `Dramatiq`.

**Patterns**

* Use adapters (ports & adapters) so tests can inject mocks.
* Provide factory + singleton bindings in IoC container.

---

# 3. Data & Business Logic

**Goal:** robust domain model layer and stable data contracts.

**Structure**

```
erp/modules/<module>/
  models.py          # ORM models + mixins (timestamps, soft delete)
  repository.py      # DB access via repository pattern
  services.py        # business actions / domain services
  schemas.py         # pydantic DTOs for I/O
  workflows/         # saga/orchestrators, step functions
  migrations/        # alembic or equivalent
```

**Key features**

* DTOs (`pydantic`) for API contract + validation.
* Repositories isolate ORM — allows multi-DB strategies.
* Transformers map ORM → API/read models (CQRS read models optional).
* Multi-tenant strategies: `schema-per-tenant` OR `shared-schema + tenant_id` with row-level scoping.

**Versioning**

* Keep API and DB migration versions tied to module versions.
* Provide `erp/cortex/versioning.py` to manage compatibility checks at module load.

---

# 4. Security & Compliance

* DLP & PII handling: tag sensitive fields and apply field-level encryption.

**Testing & CI**

* SAST/DAST runs in CI.
* Security regression tests and permission matrix checks.

---

# 5. Extensibility & Customization

  * Hook points: `before_create`, `after_update`, `on_login`, `before_migrate`, etc.
* **Theme Engine** — `erp/cortex/themes/loader.py`

  * Asset override strategy: core assets ← tenant theme ← plugin assets.
* **Custom Fields** — `erp/modules/<module>/custom_fields.py` using JSONB and mapping service.

**Safety**

* Plugins run in sandboxed processes or limited permission contexts when required.
* Plugin signing and marketplace vetting recommended.

---

* GitOps (ArgoCD) + CI (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI): build, test, SAST, DAST, canary deploy.
* Blue/Green or Canary deployments for critical services.
* Backup & DR: scheduled snapshots, cross-region replication, documented RTO/RPO.
* Chaos experiments for resilience testing.

**Developer DX**

* Local dev sandbox: `devstack` scripts to run services with test fixtures.
* Scaffolding CLI in `prefiq/` to generate modules, controllers, tests.

---

# 10. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal:** ensure correctness and contract stability.

**Tests**

* Unit tests (`pytest`), integration tests, contract tests (Pact), E2E (Playwright/Cypress), load tests (k6).
* Contract tests for APIs + Feature flagged behavior.
* Security tests: SAST, DAST in pipeline.

**Coverage**

* Gate merges on test + coverage thresholds and passing security checks.

---

# 11. Governance, Policies & Documentation

**Goal:** consistent architecture decisions and operational policies.

**Artifacts**

* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `/docs/adr/`.
* Data contracts & schemas registered in a schema registry (Avro/Protobuf).
* Policy docs: retention, encryption, access control.
* Module owner metadata for accountability.

# 13. Non-Functional Requirements (quick, actionable)

* **Availability:** 99.95% for core API, multi-AZ DB.
* **RTO/RPO:** define per critical module (example: Payments RTO = 15min, RPO = 1hr).
* **Latency:** 95th percentile API response < 300ms (tunable per endpoint).
* **Throughput:** autoscale policies based on QPS & MQ backlog.
* **Security:** SOC2/ISO-27001 baseline for production.

# 14. Quick Implementation Checklist (MVP → Production)

1. Implement minimal `cortex/bootstrap.py`, IoC, config loader, logger.
2. Build `apps/inventory` with models, repo, service, controller, routes, tests.
3. Add DB provider + migrations and basic cache provider.
4. Expose API via a simple API Gateway (or reverse proxy) and sample UI.
5. Add eventbus (local dev: in-memory, prod: Kafka).
6. Add plugin loader & one sample plugin.
7. Integrate observability (OpenTelemetry + Prometheus).
8. Add auth (JWT/OAuth2) + RBAC.
9. Onboard CI/CD + SAST/DAST + backup routine.
10. Add AI pipelines and feature store when stable data volume exists.
