# Codexion — Cortex

**Enterprise & Military-Grade Python ERP Core with AI Integration**

---

## Executive Summary

**Codexion — Cortex** is a modular, Python-based ERP and AI/ML-ready platform purpose-built for high-security enterprise and defense environments. It provides deterministic system initialization, structured lifecycle control, advanced security protocols, governance mechanisms, and multi-tenant extensibility for SaaS, on-premises, and edge deployments.

---

## Mission & Goals

* Deliver a unified platform for mission-critical ERP with embedded AI capabilities.
* Support extensibility while minimizing the trusted computing base.
* Comply with enterprise and defense standards, including cryptographic security, supply-chain integrity, RBAC/PBAC, and comprehensive audit logging.
* Enable hybrid, air-gapped, and offline deployment models.

---

## High-Level Capabilities

* Deterministic boot and lifecycle management with defined hooks.
* Modular ERP domains with versioned, stable APIs.
* AI/MLOps infrastructure: feature store, model registry, drift detection.
* Security architecture: encryption, HSM/KMS integration, signed artifacts, RBAC/PBAC.
* Governance framework: ADRs, policy engine, retention policies.
* Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, immutable logging.
* Extensible plugin system with signature validation and sandboxing.
* DevOps: GitOps workflows, reproducible builds, staged rollouts.

## Architecture Principles

1. Apply Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth.
2. Maintain immutable, reproducible builds.
3. Enforce strict separation of concerns.
4. Define explicit service and data contracts.
5. Ensure comprehensive observability and testing.
6. Default to secure configurations.

## Core Blueprint

1. **Boot & Lifecycle:** Secure configuration loading, artifact verification, lifecycle hooks (`on_preboot`, `on_boot`), signed log generation.
2. **Core Services:** Config loader, DI container, structured logging, event bus, provider registry; hardened with adapters, rate limiting, and KMS-based secrets.
3. **Data & Domains:** Organized module layout, Pydantic DTOs, schema registry, versioned migrations.
4. **Security & Compliance:** OIDC/OAuth2, mTLS, RBAC/PBAC, HSM/KMS integration, signed builds, sandboxing, encryption.
5. **Extensibility:** Manifest-based, signed plugins with sandbox execution; curated plugin marketplace.
6. **Observability:** Health endpoints, distributed tracing, metrics dashboards, incident playbooks.
7. **AI & Analytics:** Secure ingestion, feature store, governed pipelines, controlled model serving, drift detection.
8. **Deployment:** SaaS, air-gapped, edge, and offline-ready modes; hardened infrastructure.
9. **DevOps:** GitOps pipelines, environment isolation, disaster recovery, chaos testing.
10. **Testing:** Unit, integration, contract, E2E, and load testing.
11. **Governance:** ADR documentation, policy enforcement, compliance templates.

## Non-Functional Targets

* **Availability:** 99.95%
* **Latency:** <300ms (95th percentile)
* **Scalability:** Auto-scaling under sustained load
* **Security Baseline:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, FIPS compliance

## Roadmap

**MVP:** Bootstrap system, DI, secure configuration, and logging. Implement core modules, initial ERP domains, and CI/CD pipeline with automated tests.

**Hardened Release:** Full security hardening, advanced observability, compliance alignment, disaster recovery, and chaos engineering exercises.
